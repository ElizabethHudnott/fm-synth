Bugs
----
Only respond to MIDI when visible/active?
When envelope reset is on then keep the phase synchronized by applying the longest dampening time to all (reset) operators
delay stage should happen after dampening
Dampening phase should only apply when attenuation is < 0x200
SSG loop should include attack phase (modes 0 and 4) (but it isn't 4x faster)
SSG should only run at 4x speed while attenuation is < 0x200
Oscillator phase should reset on each SSG loop for modes 0 and 4
	Oscillator should stay paused until attenuation is < 0x200

Necessary Improvements
----------------------
Option to not reset phase
Filter key tracking and glide
Renumber operators 2 & 3?
Refactor operator UI
Finish UI (prioritize: SSG, envelope reset)
Icon/logo
OPN presets
User presets

Lower Priority
--------------
Quick edit (DX11 manual p.13), including "tone" (all modulator levels, Ableton) and balance (between outputs, Digitone)
on screen keyboard
AM envelopes
Use slider to control coarse and fine (detune2) ratios together
testing
Make envelope diagram dynamic
Add "Key On" and "Key Off" annotations to envelope diagram
tremolo & auto pan phase offset
Reading .value is broken in chrome
linearValueAtTime - check values saved appropriately
