Bugs
----
polyphonic glide doesn't work if previous glide hasn't completed
tremolo polarity
feedback strength (when n=7)?
Correct beginLevel when there's a velocity change
When envelope reset is on then keep the phase synchronized by applying the longest dampening time to all operators
	delay stage should happen after dampening
	add initial phase parameter
Reading .value is broken in chrome
fade in of vibrato is slow
linearValueAtTime - check values saved appropriately
SSG loop should include attack phase (modes 0 and 4)
Oscillator phase should reset on each SSG loop for modes 0 and 4


Tweaks
------
Change panning implementation
Use slider to control coarse and fine (detune2) ratios together
Tabindexes in the custom algorithm section?
Add "Key On" and "Key Off" annotations to envelope diagram


Necessary Improvements
----------------------
testing
add differentiation of log saw
MIDI input
Portamento
Renumber operators 2 & 3?
Use Algorithm 4 at start-up, Operators 3 & 4 (will be 2 & 4) disabled
AM envelopes
Refactor operator UI
Finish UI
Quick edit (DX11 manual p.13)
Icon/logo
OPN presets
User presets
Service worker
WAV output
graphics
