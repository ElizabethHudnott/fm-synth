Bugs
----
feedback path shouldn't go through the envelope
modulation should scale according to modulator frequency, not carrier frequency
Correct beginLevel when there's a velocity change
Reading .value is broken in chrome
fade in of vibrato is slow
linearValueAtTime - check values saved appropriately
SSG loop should include attack phase (modes 0 and 4)
Oscillator phase should reset on each SSG loop for modes 0 and 4


Tweaks
------
Change distortion into decibels
Use slider to control coarse and fine (detune2) ratios together
Tabindexes in the custom algorithm section?
Add "Key On" and "Key Off" annotations to envelope diagram


Necessary Improvements
----------------------
add differentiation of log saw
Split into separate files: envelope, operator, channel, synth
Computer keyboard input
MIDI input
Portamento
Phase reset (on/off/auto)
Renumber operators 2 & 3?
Change defaults when used through UI: Algorithm 4, Operators 3 & 4 (will be 2 & 4) disabled
AM envelopes
Level scaling (SY77 and OPL styles, and DX7ii?)
Refactor operator UI
Finish UI
Name and icon/logo
OPN presets
User presets
Service worker
WAV output
