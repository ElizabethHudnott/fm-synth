Bugs
----
Turning LFO frequency to zero doesn't reset phase when key sync is off
	Nor should it when not using UI
Correct beginLevel when there's a velocity change
When envelope reset is on then keep the phase synchronized by applying the longest dampening time to all operators
delay stage should happen after dampening
SSG loop should include attack phase (modes 0 and 4)
Oscillator phase should reset on each SSG loop for modes 0 and 4

Necessary Improvements
----------------------
add differentiation of log saw
Renumber operators 2 & 3
Refactor operator UI
Finish UI (prioritize: velocity, SSG, envelope reset)
Icon/logo
OPN presets
User presets
graphics

Lower Priority
--------------
Quick edit (DX11 manual p.13)
on screen keyboard
AM envelopes
Use slider to control coarse and fine (detune2) ratios together
testing
Add "Key On" and "Key Off" annotations to envelope diagram
tremolo polarity
feedback strength when n=7
Reading .value is broken in chrome
linearValueAtTime - check values saved appropriately
