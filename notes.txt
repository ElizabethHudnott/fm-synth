Wanted Feature List / Change List
---------------------------------
Algorithms on Other Systems
	1 -> 2 & 3 -> 4		(Bleass, Dirtywave M8) diamond shape
	1 -> 2 -> 3 & 4		(Bleass, Dirtywave M8)
	1 & 2 & 3 -> 4			(DX7, Bleass, Dirtywave M8)
	1 -> 2 & 3, 4			(DX7, Dirtywave M8)
	1->2&4, 3->2&4			Algorithm 4 + more (Digitone)
	1->2&3, 2->3, 3->4	(Digitone)
Renumber operators 2 & 3

Bug: Reading .value is broken in chrome
Bug: mixPCM doesn't support 2-op channels

Add "Key On" and "Key Off" annotations to envelope diagram

Bug: feedback needs to be scaled by pitch
Bug: feedback path shouldn't go through the envelope
Bug: pitch bend needs to account for feedback
Bug?: slow fade in of vibrato

Split into separate files: envelope, operator, channel, synth
Add second release stage to envelopes
AM envelopes
Operator ratio bend
	Separate ratio node
Operator frequency offset in Hz

Envelope trigger method (regardless of key currently on or off)
Ability to make parameters velocity sensitive (e.g. filter envelope amount, LFO effects?)
Individual oscillator(?): envelope reset on/off, free running on/off?
envelopes synced to tempo?
attenuation bend and velocity?

Noise/S&H/sample as LFO source?
Level scaling (per operator) (DX7 style? Or SY77? OR OPL?)
glide

Oscillator phase should reset on each SSG loop for modes 0 and 4
	hard sync effect. Like Casio CZ?
negative sustain rates
envelope shift
Add panning to PSG (like Sega Game Gear?)
White noise as a modulator (through filter + resonance?)

OPL2/3-like features
	Compatibility
		Separate LFOs for pitch and volume?

CSM mode?

Amplitude Bend
	Plain (how will this work with 2-op channels?)
	Repeating via SSG

Filter envelope (paraphonic) triggered either by every note on or only after all notes off.
	Can be inverted
	Cutoff can keytrack oscillator pitch

Feedback amount envelope (or bend?)
	Looping bends?

Delay/Chorus unit

Custom waveforms
	Only available for an operator that is not modulated by another operator or itself

Microtuning (step offsets for PSG, randomization/analog?)

UI
	Tabindexes in the custom algorithm section
	Warn user when attempting to apply an LFO effect and the LFO's frequency is zero.
	2 op / 4 op selector UI
	Separate coarse (restricted to odd or even?) and fine (fractional) frequency ratio sliders
	Pad LED display with trailing zeros after decimal point
	More intense red LEDs
	Custom waveform editor? (max 64 time steps, 4-6 bit levels, like Famicom Disk System)
