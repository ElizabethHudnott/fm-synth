Wanted Feature List / Change List
---------------------------------
New algorithms
	1 -> 2 & 3 -> 4
	1 -> 2 -> 3 & 4
	1 & 2 & 3 -> 4

Bug: Reading .value is broken in chrome
Bug: mixPCM doesn't support 2-op channels

Add "Key On" and "Key Off" annotations to envelope diagram
and change to a dynamic diagram

Envelope trigger method (regardless of key currently on or off)
Ability to sync LFO to song tempo or to note on

Tremolo preset depth 0..128
Allow special mode to act as fixed or +/- the current note
Noise as LFO source
Level scaling (per operator)

Add panning to PSG (like Sega Game Gear?)
White noise as a modulator

OPL2/3-like features
	"Detune" two halves to have different frequencies
	Compatibility
		Separate LFOs for pitch and volume?

CSM mode

Pitch Bend
	How to handle special mode?
	Any sequence of straight lines (triggered by note on or as a tracker effect)
	Scaled by velocity?
Amplitude Bend
	Plain
	Repeating via SSG

Filter envelope (paraphonic) triggered either by every note on or only after all notes off.
	Auto Wah

Feedback amount envelope

Delay/Chorus unit

Custom waveforms
	Only available for an operator that is not modulated by another operator or itself
		No vibrato applied

Microtuning?

UI
	Warn user when attempting to apply an LFO effect and the LFO's frequency is zero.
	2 op / 4 op selector UI
	Separate coarse and fine (fractional) frequency ratio sliders
	Pad LED display with trailing zeros
	More intense red LEDs
	Custom waveform editor (max 32 time steps, 4-6 bit levels, like Famicom Disk System)
