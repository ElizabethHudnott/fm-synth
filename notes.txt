Algorithms on Other Systems (to consider)

	1 -> 2 & 3, 4			(DX7, Dirtywave M8)
	1->2&4, 3->2&4			Algorithm 4 + more (Digitone)
	1->2&3, 2->3->4		(Digitone)
Renumber operators 2 & 3?

Bug: Reading .value is broken in chrome
Bug: mixPCM doesn't support 2-op channels
Changing channel volume while PCM is in use doesn't work (problem?)

Add "Key On" and "Key Off" annotations to envelope diagram

Bug: modulation should scale according to modulator frequency, not carrier frequency
Bug: feedback path shouldn't go through the envelope
Bug?: slow fade in of vibrato

Split into separate files: envelope, operator, channel, synth
Change distortion into decibels
Correct beginLevel when there's a velocity change
Phase reset (on/off/auto)
	When on (or auto) then keep phase synchronized (by using the longest dampening time for all operators) when using envelope reset mode? No?
Sustain on/off envelope option (one shot)
Envelope trigger method (regardless of key currently on or off)
Add second release stage to envelopes (from -18db, interdependent across operators, see "reverb" in DX11 manual)
AM envelopes
Operator ratio bend
	Separate ratio node
Operator frequency offset? (in frequency numbers) (can be combined with a ratio)
Fixed operator with partial key tracking ("frequency key scaling") (as 0..99 centred on C3) (FS1R)
add differentiation of log saw

linearValueAtTime - check values saved appropriately
Ability to make parameters velocity sensitive (e.g. filter envelope amount, resonance (FS1R))
envelopes synced to tempo?
attenuation bend and velocity?

Noise/S&H/sample as LFO source?
Level scaling (per operator) (DX7 style? Or DX7 ii? Or SY77? Or OPL? Or OPP?)
glide

Oscillator phase should reset on each SSG loop for modes 0 and 4
	hard sync effect. Like Casio CZ?
SSG loop should include attack phase (modes 0 and 4)
envelope shift
Add panning to PSG (like Sega Game Gear?)
White noise as a modulator? (through filter + resonance?)

PSG
	reciprocal node?
	wave sequencing (alternate pulse and saw using a square wave LFO)

OPL2/3-like features
	Compatibility
		Fast envelope setting (matching OPL clock rate)
		Separate LFOs for pitch and volume?

One operator channels

Amplitude Bend
	How will it work with 2-op channels?
	Repeating via SSG

Filter envelope (paraphonic) triggered either by every note on or only after all notes off.
	Can be inverted
	Cutoff can keytrack oscillator pitch
	Velocity can affect attack rate
	Input gain (can be -ve to avoid overloading due to resonance)?

Feedback amount envelope (or bend?)
	Looping bends?

Delay/Chorus unit

WAV output

Combine sample with synth
	Roland Linear Arithmetic Synthesis
	Korg Advanced Integrated synthesis (M1)
	Casio ZPI & Advanced and High Quality Large Waveform
	Ensoniq Cross Wave Synthesis (SQ-80)
	Kawai Digital Multi Spectrum (K4)
	Yamaha SY77, etc.

Custom waveforms
	Only available for an operator that is not modulated by another operator or itself

Microtuning (step offsets for PSG, getMIDINote for PSG, randomization/analog?)

More Ideas
	Velocity sensitive detuning

UI
	Tabindexes in the custom algorithm section
	Warn user when attempting to apply an LFO effect and the LFO's frequency is zero.
	2 op / 4 op selector UI
	Use slider to control coarse and fine (detune2) ratios together
	Pad LED display with trailing zeros after decimal point
	More intense red LEDs
	Custom waveform editor? (max 64 time steps, 4-6 bit levels, like Famicom Disk System)
