fm-x waves
Only respond to MIDI when visible/active?
Bug: Reading .value is broken in chrome
Bug: mixPCM doesn't support 2-op channels
Changing channel volume while PCM is in use doesn't work (problem?)

Make envelope diagram dynamic
Add "Key On" and "Key Off" annotations to envelope diagram

tremolo & auto pan phase offset
Bug: feedback strength (when n=7)?

Correct beginLevel when there's a velocity change
When envelope reset is on then keep the phase synchronized by applying the longest dampening time to all operators
	delay stage should happen after dampening
	add initial phase parameter
Sustain on/off envelope option (one shot)
Add second release stage to envelopes (from -18db, interdependent across operators, see "reverb" in DX11 manual)
AM envelopes
Operator ratio bend
	Separate ratio node (so it works with pitch bend and glide)
Operator frequency offset? (in frequency numbers) (can be combined with a ratio)
Fixed operator with partial key tracking ("frequency key scaling") (as -200..200 with specified centre key) (FM-X & FS1R)
add differentiation of log saw
compressor doesn't support soft knee
compressor doesn't work with pre-gain higher than 4
only run lfo when tremolo, vibrato, panbrello, etc. depth is non-zero

linearValueAtTime - check values saved appropriately
Ability to make parameters velocity sensitive (e.g. distortion, filter envelope amount, resonance (FS1R))
envelopes synced to tempo?
attenuation bend and velocity?

lfo key sync: on/off/first on

Noise/S&H/sample as LFO source?
Level scaling (per operator)
	Breakpoint
	Left and right depths (change in output level)
	Left and right curves (+linear, -linear, +exponential, -exponential, +stepped (OPL style), -stepped)
	Can be applied to filter resonance too

Oscillator phase should reset on each SSG loop for modes 0 and 4
	hard sync effect. Like Casio CZ?
SSG loop should include attack phase (modes 0 and 4)
envelope shift

	http://www.quadibloc.com/other/cnv05.htm
	147mm and 100mm lengths

LFO centering (only up / only down / bipolar)?

Filter
	Separate wet/dry per channel
	Separate filters for FM and PSG? (Per voice for FM?)

PSG
	separate into multiple files
	overall volume control for patch
	panning (but no modulation)
	glide (no stepping)
	pitch bend
	discrete pitch movements
		bends (sometimes looping) simulating vibrato or envelope
		based on frequency numbers
	looping envelope
	filter envelope
	LFO delay & fade, LFOs per voice, optional key sync (like FM LFO)
	see AY8930 (only use envelope per voice from the enhanced features), Super PSG and inSIDious manuals for more ideas
	No separate tremolo
		Generalize envelope to support custom waveforms, AM or custom envelopes (up to 64 steps, 31 levels), looping or not
		Quick options to create tremolo
		Noise channel only has a regular, non-looping envelope
	new oscillator on each key on? Need to prevent frequency going too low
	noise channel
		option to configure LFSR polynomial and noise bit depth and starting value and repetitions of each sample
		tidy up code
	per channel tunings
	generalize getMIDINote to handle different interval and divisions values
	replace calcKeyCode with less jumpy version

OPL2/3-like features
	Compatibility
		Fast envelope setting (matching OPL clock rate)
		Separate LFOs for pitch and volume?

One operator channels

Setting to let LFO track note frequency at low-ish speeds (pseudo 5th operator)? Why only low?
	Settings: octave(?) and detune
	Montage OS v3 goes up to 1356.59Hz

Amplitude Bend
	How will it work with 2-op channels?
	Repeating via SSG

Filter envelope (paraphonic) triggered either by every note on or only after all notes off.
	Can be inverted
	Cutoff can keytrack oscillator pitch
	Velocity can affect attack rate
	Input gain (can be -ve to avoid overloading due to resonance)?

Looping bends?

Delay/Chorus unit

WAV output

Combine sample with synth
	Roland Linear Arithmetic Synthesis
	Korg Advanced Integrated synthesis (M1)
	Casio ZPI & Advanced and High Quality Large Waveform
	Ensoniq Cross Wave Synthesis (SQ-80)
	Kawai Digital Multi Spectrum (K4)
	Yamaha SY77, etc.

Custom waveforms?
	Only available for an operator that is not modulated by another operator or itself

makeBasicWaveform
	alternating / invert every x repetitions (see also SY-77 waveforms)
	trapezoid option (as fraction that is flat, increase sine/tri frequency as needed)

Microtuning
	step offsets for PSG
	getMIDINote for PSG

MIDI messages
	sustain
	mod wheel
		assignable to volume, vibrato depth or tremolo depth (any combination, 3 sensitivity controls)
	foot controller (CC4)
		assignable to volume, vibrato depth or tremolo depth
	expression (alters volume) (CC11)
	program change

			Pitch Bend
			Mod Wheel	Aftertouch	Foot	Breath
Volume		X							X
Vibrato		X				X			X			X
Tremolo		X				X			X			X
Pitch			X				X						X
EG Bias						X						X

"Performance Play" (from DX11)?
	A performance:
		alternates through instruments in sequence (+detune, transpose, volume, "pan", microtuning on/off) OR
		splits the keyboard by note number (lower bound, upper bound, modulo arithmetic)
Chord playing "chord set"? (DX11)

Panning based on LFO, velocity or note number

Series: Yamaha DX11, TX81Z, TQ5, YS200, V50

More Ideas
	Velocity sensitive detuning

Customizable damping time?

UI
	Quick edit (DX11 manual p.13)
	Tabindexes in the custom algorithm section
	Warn user when attempting to apply an LFO effect and the LFO's frequency is zero.
	2 op / 4 op selector UI
	Use slider to control coarse and fine (detune2) ratios together
	Pad LED display with trailing zeros after decimal point
	More intense red LEDs
