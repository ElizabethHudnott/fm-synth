Pitch bend
Ability to sync LFO to song tempo
Bigger detune
Level scaling


OPM-like features
	Noise?

OPL2/3-like features
	2 op / 4 op selector UI
	"Detune" two halves to have different frequencies
	Compatibility
		Separate LFOs for pitch and volume
		Algorithm like Algorithm 6 but with the operators re-numbered.

Envelopes
	Frequency (channel)
	Frequency multiple
	Frequency (operator)
	ADSR, linear with, 3 rates (no sustain rate), 2 levels (+begin/end level)
		see DX11 manual
	Scaled by velocity?

Envelope shift (like DX11)
Custom envelope on key on after attack phase using setValuesAtTime
