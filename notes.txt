Add "Key On" and "Key Off" annotations to envelope diagram
and change to a dynamic diagram

Ability to sync LFO to song tempo or to note on

Level scaling

Add panning to PSG
White noise as a modulator

OPL2/3-like features
	"Detune" two halves to have different frequencies
	Compatibility
		Separate LFOs for pitch and volume?

Envelopes
	Frequency of channel (pitch envelope? / pitch bend)
		How to handle special mode?
		Any sequence of straight lines (triggered by note on or tracker command)?
		Scaled by velocity?

	Custom amplitude envelope on key on after attack phase using setValuesAtTime
	Filter envelope (paraphonic) triggered either by every note on or only after all notes off.
		Auto Wah

UI
	2 op / 4 op selector UI
	Separate coarse and fine (fractional) frequency ratio sliders
	Pad LED display with trailing zeros
