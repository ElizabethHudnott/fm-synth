Wanted Feature List / Change List
---------------------------------
New algorithms
	1 -> 2 & 3 -> 4	(Bleass) Diamond
	1 -> 2 -> 3 & 4	(Bleass)
	1 & 2 & 3 -> 4		(Bleass, DX7)
	1 -> 2 & 3, 4		(DX7)

Bug: Reading .value is broken in chrome
Bug: mixPCM doesn't support 2-op channels

Add "Key On" and "Key Off" annotations to envelope diagram

Bug: feedback needs to be scaled by pitch
Bug: feedback path shouldn't go through the envelope
Bug: pitch bend needs to account for feedback

Bug: re-enabling a modulator doesn't work until the waveform is changed

Bug: glitchy tremolo and slow fade in of vibrato
Operator frequency offset in Hz
General envelope speed parameter
Envelope trigger method (regardless of key currently on or off)
Ability to make parameters velocity sensitive (e.g. envelope speed, filter envelope amount, LFO effects?)
Individual oscillator(?): envelope reset on/off, free running on/off, affected by pitch envelope on/off?
envelopes synced to tempo?

Algorithm matrix: when an operator is routed two different ways, should it use the same envelope?
Noise/S&H/sample as LFO source?
Level scaling (per operator)
glide

Add panning to PSG (like Sega Game Gear?)
White noise as a modulator (through filter + resonance?)

OPL2/3-like features
	Compatibility
		Separate LFOs for pitch and volume?

CSM mode?

Amplitude Bend
	Plain (how will this work with 2-op channels?)
	Repeating via SSG

Filter envelope (paraphonic) triggered either by every note on or only after all notes off.
	Auto Wah

Feedback amount envelope (or bend?)
	Looping bends?

Delay/Chorus unit

Custom waveforms
	Only available for an operator that is not modulated by another operator or itself
		No vibrato applied

Microtuning (offsets for PSG, randomization/analog?)

UI
	Warn user when attempting to apply an LFO effect and the LFO's frequency is zero.
	2 op / 4 op selector UI
	Separate coarse (restricted to odd or even?) and fine (fractional) frequency ratio sliders
	Pad LED display with trailing zeros
	More intense red LEDs
	Custom waveform editor (max 64 time steps, 4-6 bit levels, like Famicom Disk System)
