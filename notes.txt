Wanted Feature List / Change List
---------------------------------
New algorithms
	1 -> 2 & 3 -> 4	(Bleass) Diamond
	1 -> 2 -> 3 & 4	(Bleass)
	1 & 2 & 3 -> 4		(Bleass, DX7)
	1 -> 2 & 3, 4		(DX7)

Bug: Reading .value is broken in chrome
Bug: mixPCM doesn't support 2-op channels

Add "Key On" and "Key Off" annotations to envelope diagram

Ability to copy settings from one operator to another
General envelope speed parameter
Envelope trigger method (regardless of key currently on or off)
Ability to make parameters velocity sensitive (E.g. vibrato depth?)

Noise/S&H/sample as LFO source?
Level scaling (per operator)
glide

Add panning to PSG (like Sega Game Gear?)
White noise as a modulator

OPL2/3-like features
	Compatibility
		Separate LFOs for pitch and volume?

CSM mode?

Amplitude Bend
	Plain (how will this work with 2-op channels?)
	Repeating via SSG

Filter envelope (paraphonic) triggered either by every note on or only after all notes off.
	Auto Wah

Feedback amount envelope

Delay/Chorus unit

Custom waveforms
	Only available for an operator that is not modulated by another operator or itself
		No vibrato applied

Microtuning?

UI
	Warn user when attempting to apply an LFO effect and the LFO's frequency is zero.
	2 op / 4 op selector UI
	Separate coarse (restricted to odd or even?) and fine (fractional) frequency ratio sliders
	Pad LED display with trailing zeros
	More intense red LEDs
	Custom waveform editor (max 64 time steps, 4-6 bit levels, like Famicom Disk System)
