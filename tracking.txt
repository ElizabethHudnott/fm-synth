* Support negative note delays
* Support accent/note contrast transform parameter

N Any hexadecimal digit

Note Track Fields
	Note Delay (in ticks)

	Pitch
		Note & octave: change pitch
		Empty: preserve previous pitch

	Dynamics
		00 Slur/Legato
		NN Key on with specified velocity
		-1	Rest (displayed as REST in the pitch column)

	Instrument
		00 Continue using the previously selected instrument
		NN Select a new instrument and reset volume control to maximum unless otherwise specified

	Effects

Master Control Track Fields
	Effects

P = Pitch Effects
	Portamento
		with optional speed change (or reuse previous)
	Arpeggio
		optional note offsets (one or more of them, scale degrees + sharp/flat) (or reuse previous)
		One pitch change per tick
		Turns on note retrigger (on every tick) by default
		Can't be present in the same cell as pitch bend
	Pitch Bend
		Can't be present in the same cell as arpeggio

V = Volume Effects (max 1 per cell)
	Volume Bend
	Set Volume (with optional delay)

P = Panning Effects (max 1 per cell)
	Panning Bend
	Set Panning

M = Modulation (any number of)
	LFO Rate
	LFO Shape
	LFO Sync
	Vibrato Depth
	Tremolo Depth

A = Articulation (any number of)
	Change Articulation
		i.e. the fraction of time notes are held for prior to release before to next note
	Retrigger note
		with a retrigger time in ticks and optional velocity change (add/subtract/multiple)
		ignores line boundaries if successive rows contain a retrigger effect with the same retrigger time
		reuses previous pitch if a new one is not specified

Other Standard Effects
	Set ticks per line

Sample Effects
	Sample Offset
	Sample Fine-Tune
	Reverse
	Funk Loop

Other Note Effects
	New Note Action (cut or continue) (samples only)
	Set scale (for transposing, arpeggios)
	Operator Modulation Depth Bend (effectively a custom envelope)
	Feedback
	Chance?

Macros
	Operator ratio

Master Control Effects
	Pattern Delay (extra time for effects to run)
	Set Tempo (absolute or relative +/- or relative multiple or reciprocal of multiple)
	Loop Start
	Loop End
	Chance?

Not an effect but the pattern list data includes
	groove (optional, not per track)
	starting offset (so fragments of longer phrases can be placed inside shorter patterns)
	loop on/off and loop start point (so shorter phrases can be repeated inside longer patterns)
	transposition
	velocity adjustment
	initial instrument
	direction (forward/reverse/forward then back/back then forward/random)
	...?

Implementation Details
	Turn sound off (dampen) when simultaneously changing instrument and keying on

ProTracker notes
	Nested loops using different columns

Instrument Editor
	Option to disable transposing (for percussion)

Editing
	Transpose needs to take the musical scale into account?
	MOD 2 sample

Ideas from Stave Notation
	Named sections
