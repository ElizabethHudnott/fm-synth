Note Track Fields
	Pitch
		normal or linear or exponential slide in a specified amount of time
	Note length
		in lines and ticks or sustained or retriggered (every x ticks with optional velocity change)
	Velocity, slur, key off
	Load Instrument (or stick with previous)
		resets volume
	Effects (can be delayed by a number of ticks)

Master Control Track Fields

	Pitch Bend
	-----
	Vibrato Depth

Amplitude Effects
	Volume Bend
	Set Volume (after x ticks)
	-----
	Tremolo Depth

Modulation
	LFO Rate
	LFO Shape

Other Standard Note Effects
	Panning Bend
	Set Panning
	-----
	Loop Start (per track)
	Loop End
	Sample Offset

Macros
	Operator ratio


Master Control Effects
	Pattern Delay
	Set Tempo (absolute or relative)
	Set ticks per line
	Groove

Not an effect but the list of patterns to play includes starting offsets.

ProTracker notes
	Nested loops using different columns
	Note cut using effect can be revived using volume commands
