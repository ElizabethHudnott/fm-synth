* Support negative note delays

N Any hexadecimal digit

Note Track Fields
	Note Delay (in ticks)

	Pitch
		Note & octave: change pitch
		Empty: preserve previous pitch

	Dynamics
			(i.e. empty space) Slur or tie
		NN Key on with specified velocity
		 0	Rest

	Instrument
		00 Continue using the previously selected instrument
		NN Select a new instrument and reset volume control to maximum unless otherwise specified

	Effects

Master Control Track Fields
	Effects

N = Note Effects
	Pitch Bend
	Glide
		with optional speed change (or reuse previous)
	Pitch Ramp
	Arpeggio
		optional note offsets (one or more of them, scale degrees + sharp/flat) (or reuse previous)
		Implies retrigger effect
		One pitch change per retrigger
			set articulation to 100% if retriggering is undesirable
		Randomization options
			Random order (on/off) (no adjacent repeated pitches)
	Ornamentation
		Run a table of:
			Pitch offsets expressed as scale degrees + sharp/flat
			Trigger (yes/on)
			Effect (glissando/frequency ramp/none)
			Table is stretched or compressed to fit the note length

	Permitted Combinations
						Bend	Glide	Ramp	Arpeggio	Ornamentation
	Bend				-		N		Y*		N			N
	Glide				-		-		N		Y			N
	Ramp				-		-		-		Y			N
	Arpeggio			-		-		-		-			N
	* Ramps from some previous pitch, bends to future pitches


V = Volume Effects (max 1 per cell)
	Set Volume (with optional delay)
	Volume Ramp
	Volume Bend

P = Panning Effects (max 1 per cell)
	Set Panning
	Panning Ramp
	Panning Bend

M = Modulation (any number of)
	LFO Rate
	LFO Shape & Sync
	Vibrato Depth
	Tremolo Depth
	Panbrello Depth

A = Articulation (any number of)
	Gate Length / Change Articulation
		i.e. the fraction of time notes are held for prior to release before to next note
	Retrigger note
		with a retrigger time in ticks and optional velocity change (add/subtract/multiple)
		ignores line boundaries if successive rows contain a retrigger effect with the same retrigger time
		reuses previous pitch if a new one is not specified via arpeggio command
	Set ticks per line

Sample Effects
	New Note Action (fade, continue/end loop or cut) (samples only)
	Sample Offset
	Sample Fine-Tune
	Reverse
	Funk Loop

Other Note Track Effects
	Set Distortion
	Random instrument (for slight variations)
	Set scale (for transposing, arpeggios)
	Operator Modulation Depth Bend (effectively a custom envelope)
	Feedback
	Fill?

Macros
	Operator ratio

Master Control Effects
	Dynamic range compression
	Pattern Delay (extra time for effects to run, whole repeats + fraction)
	Set Tempo (absolute or relative +/-)
		Issue: negative delay + slowing tempo could result in going back more than 1 row
	Change grid resolution
		Multiplies lines per minute, e.g. 2, 3, 1/2, 1/3, etc.
		Changes lines per beat on every track

Not an effect but the pattern list data includes
	random velocity changes
	random gate length changes
	random timing changes (doesn't change number of ticks)
	transposition
	crescendo/decrescendo
	direction (forward/reverse/forward then back/back then forward/random)
	...?

Song Structure
	Sections (chains)
	Repeat x times
	Multiple phrases per track for each pattern, with one chosen during playback based on
		External variables (horizontal resequencing)
			Switches at the beginning of the next bar
		Randomization
			E.g. play phrase A, D or E
			Re-randomize each time the phrase loops (on/off)
		Empty phrase can also be an option (vertical re-orchestration)
			Option to fade in, fade out, both or neither when going to / from the empty phrase?

Implementation Details
	Turn sound off (dampen) when simultaneously changing instrument and keying on

Effects with Memory
	Arpeggio
	Retrigger
	LFO Rate
	Vibrato
	Tremolo
	Panbrello
	Sample Offset
	Relative tempo change

Instrument Editor
	Option to disable transposing (for percussion)

Editing
	Transpose needs to take the musical scale into account?
	MOD 2 sample

Ideas from Stave Notation
	Named sections
